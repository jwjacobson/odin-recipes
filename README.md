The Odin Project recipes assignment

This is my first major assignment as part of The Odin Project. I'll be making a simple recipe site consisting of a few pages using Git and VSCode. I'll be practicing html, file structure, and git commit syntax.

As I learn CSS, I'll be making further modifications incorporating what I've learned.
