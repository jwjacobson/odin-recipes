        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my recipe for barley pilaf.</p>
        <p>It's easy and very adaptable depending on what you have on hand.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup barley</li>
                <li>3 cups water or stock, plus a splash extra at the end</li>
                <li>1-2 carrots</li>
                <li>1-2 stalks celery</li>
                <li>1/2-1 onion</li>
                <li>other vegetables as desired (frozen peas or sauteed mushrooms are good)</li>
                <li>olive oil</li>
                <li>2 tbs butter, softened on the counter</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
                <li>garlic powder</li>
                <li>onion powder</li>
                <li>paprika</li>
                <li>turmeric powder</li>
                <li>fresh parsley</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h3>Cook the barley</h3>
            <ol>    
                <li>Heat barley, water/stock, and a pinch of salt in a pot to a full boil</li>
                <li>Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until barley is tender, 30-60 minutes</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>note on barley:</h4>            
                    <p>I find barley cooking time varies a lot, so taste and don't be afraid to add another 1/2 cup of liquid if it's getting dry but the barley's not done yet.
                    I like to start it fairly early to make sure it has time to get done. It can just sit in the pot until you're ready for it.</p>
                
        <h3>Make the pilaf</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Finely chop carrot, celery and onion</li>
                <li>Heat oil on medium heat in a large pan</li>
                <li>Add vegetables with a generous pinch of salt</li>
                <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until soft but not mushy</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low, add cooked barley and other vegetables if using, stir along with the extra stock to incorporate</li>
                <li>Season as desired, being sure to taste (turmeric adds beautiful golden color)</li>
                <li>Stir in butter</li>
                <li>Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with fresh parsley</li>
            </ol>
